        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Don't be fooled by the name, this style of pizza is actually a Canadian invention!</p>
        <p>A deliciously baked crust, a base of classic tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella, topped with sliced ham and the ever controversial chunks of pineapple that give this pizza it's tropical flavour</p>
        <h3 class="ingredients sub-heading">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pizza dough</li>
                <li>1tbs oliv oil</li>
                <li>1tbs  cornmeal</li>
                <li>half-cup pizza sauce</li>
                <li>1 and a half cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>half-cup cooked ham, sliced or chopped</li>
                <li>half-cup fresh pineapple chunks</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="steps sub-heading">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 475F (246C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush olive oil all over the dough</li>
                <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the surface of the dough to your preference, then add cheese</li>
                <li>Finally, add ham and pineapple. I recommend adding extra pineapple to upset those who don't appreciate the beauty of a Hawaiian pizza</li>
                <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes before slicing and serving</li>
            </ol>
