This repo contains my frist real project I'm making through The Odin Project. The project will be a basic HTML webpage for recipes, linking to various recipes from the web and show what I've learned so far. I will likely append this after completion of the project

Ok, the project is over and I  think I need to remember to commit more often. I didn't do my first commit until I was basically done with the first recipe. Only time I remembered to commit as I was coding was in the parmesan garlic ramen recipe. I'll have to keep that in mind going forward and commit more often so I can keep a better record of what I'm doing. 

Other than that I think I did a good job of demonstrating my abilities so far. I feel proud of myself for what I've created.
